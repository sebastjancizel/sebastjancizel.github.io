## About Me

I'm a research scientist with expertise in **machine learning**, **probability**, and **programming**, currently working in computer vision, researching neural network based image and video compression algorithms at Deep Render.

### Current Position

**Research Scientist** at Deep Render  
_September 2021 - Present_

Deep Render is a start-up focusing on developing perceptually optimized image and video compression algorithms based on AI. My day-to-day work consists of developing and testing new approaches and improvements to the video compression algorithm with the aim of optimizing both the compression and runtime performance on mobile platforms.

### Background

Before venturing into deep learning, I completed a DPhil in Mathematics at the University of Oxford, focusing on the intersection of geometry and string theory. This mathematical foundation provides me with a unique perspective on machine learning algorithms and their theoretical underpinnings.
