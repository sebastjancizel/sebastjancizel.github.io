</div>

Technical lead and manager of 15 engineers responsible for productization of research models and internal hardware/software infrastructure. Built unified model inference library for major AI accelerators (Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, Intel) and CI/CD system reducing model port times from weeks to days. Spearheading the world's first integration of a neural codec into FFmpeg and VLC achieving realtime video encode and decode on consumer devices.

### Deep Render - Senior Research Scientist

_February 2023 - October 2023_

Led model quantization and pruning research achieving 2x improvements in memory footprint and runtime while retaining compression performance. Delivered client-facing applications and built model evaluation tools using Python and web stack (Vue, node).

### Deep Render - Research Scientist

_September 2021 - February 2023_

Made foundational research contributions to video compression models with >10% efficiency gains over state-of-the-art. Lead maintainer of core model codebase (PyTorch, C++, CUDA) with 60k+ lines of contributions, focusing on generative CV models and optical flow.

### Sledilnik COVID19 Tracker - Contributor

_September 2020 - May 2021_

[Sledilnik](https://covid-19.sledilnik.org/en/team) is an open source community engaged in a comprehensive effort of track COVID19 cases in Slovenia. I contributed to the visualizations of the data gathered by the community. The work involved parsing and cleaning the data using the backend written in F# and creating visualizations using the Highcharts API.
