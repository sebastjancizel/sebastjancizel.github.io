Deep Render is a start-up focusing on developing a perceptually optimized image and video compression algorithms based on AI. My day to day work consists of developing and testing new approaches and improvements to the video compression algorithm with the aim of optimizing both the compression and runtime performance on mobile platforms. I also maintain the codebase for a core video compression algorithm. The tech stack consists of Pytorch with Weighs and Biases for experiment tracking.

### Sledilnik COVID19 Tracker - Contributor

[Sledilnik](https://covid-19.sledilnik.org/en/team) is an open source community engaged in a comprehensive effort of track COVID19 cases in Slovenia. I contributed to the visualizations of the data gathered by the community. The work involved parsing and cleaning the data using the backend written in F# and creating visualizations using the Highcharts API.
