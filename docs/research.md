## Overview

Before venturing over to deep learning I did a PhD in Mathematics, focusing on the intersection of geometry and string theory. Here's a quick description of the things I was researching:

String theory has, over the past few decades, been a curious venue for a profound interaction between mathematics and physics. The efforts to formulate a fundamental quantum theory of gravity have led several branches of pure mathematics to make an appearance in physics. Most notably, geometry in its various forms has started to take on a prominent role. This was not its first appearance. Since the theory of general relativity, it has become clear that there is an inherent geometry underlying the physics of gravity. However, string theorists went beyond the 4 dimensions of space and time and started thinking about increasingly intricate higher dimensional objects.

This is what my research was about; the geometric objects — higher-dimensional shapes — that appear in string theory and how their properties manifest in the physical theories they are associated with. Usually with opaque names like G₂ manifolds or GK geometries, these shapes are often of independent mathematical interest. What makes them especially exciting is the fruitful interplay of mathematics and physics that is present. Mathematics provides the foundation for physical theories, whereas physical arguments and intuition guide the mathematical explorations.
