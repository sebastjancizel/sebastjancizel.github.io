# Blog

Welcome to my blog! Here I share thoughts on machine learning, mathematics, technology, and the interesting intersections between theory and practice.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Machine Learning Insights** - Practical experiences and theoretical perspectives from working in computer vision and neural compression
- **Mathematical Explorations** - Connections between pure mathematics and applied AI, geometric perspectives on deep learning
- **Technology Commentary** - Thoughts on emerging trends in AI, software development, and research methodologies
- **Research Updates** - Occasional updates on ongoing projects and interesting findings

## Recent Focus Areas

Currently, I'm particularly interested in writing about:

- **Neural Compression** - The intersection of information theory, perception, and deep learning
- **Mathematical Foundations** - How mathematical thinking applies to modern AI challenges
- **Research to Production** - Bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications
- **Learning Insights** - Lessons learned from transitioning from pure mathematics to applied ML
