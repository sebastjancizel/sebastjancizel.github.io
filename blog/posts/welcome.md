# Welcome to My New Website

I'm excited to share my newly redesigned website, built with Material for MkDocs! This marks a significant shift from my previous React-based portfolio to a more content-focused, markdown-driven approach.

<!-- more -->

## Why the Change?

After maintaining a traditional portfolio website for several years, I wanted something that would be:

- **Easier to maintain** - Writing in Markdown is much simpler than maintaining React components
- **Content-focused** - The emphasis is on sharing knowledge and insights rather than just showcasing projects
- **Blog-enabled** - A proper platform for sharing thoughts on machine learning, mathematics, and research
- **Fast and accessible** - Static generation ensures excellent performance and accessibility

## What's Different?

### From Portfolio to Personal Site
While my previous site was primarily a portfolio showcasing my background and projects, this new version is designed as a personal site where I can share ongoing thoughts and insights. The portfolio elements are still there, but they're now part of a broader content strategy.

### Enhanced Blog Functionality
The blog section is now a first-class citizen of the site. I plan to write about:

- **Research insights** from my work in neural compression
- **Mathematical perspectives** on machine learning
- **Technical tutorials** and lessons learned
- **Industry observations** from the intersection of academia and startups

### Modern Tooling
Material for MkDocs provides excellent developer experience with:

- Hot reloading during development
- Beautiful responsive design out of the box
- Excellent search functionality
- RSS feed generation
- Social media card generation

## What's Coming

I'm planning to migrate some of my existing technical content and add new posts covering:

- Deep dives into neural compression algorithms
- The mathematical foundations of modern deep learning
- Lessons learned from transitioning from pure mathematics to applied ML
- Technical tutorials on PyTorch, optimization, and computer vision

## Technical Notes

For those interested in the technical details, this site is built with:

- **Material for MkDocs** - Static site generator with beautiful Material Design theme
- **GitHub Pages** - Simple, reliable hosting
- **Python/Markdown** - Content written in Markdown with Python-based tooling
- **Custom CSS** - Minor customizations for personal branding

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastjancizel/sebastjancizel.github.io) for anyone interested in the implementation details.
